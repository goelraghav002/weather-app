# Weather App
The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to search for and view the current weather conditions and forecast for a given location. The app uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it in a user-friendly format. Users can search for locations by city name, ZIP code, or geographic coordinates.

## Getting started
To get started with the Weather App, simply navigate to the website's URL: 
<br/> <br/> https://goelraghav002.github.io/weather-app/

## Usage
Once the website loads, you can use the search bar at the top of the page to enter a location. The app will automatically search for the location's weather data and display it on the page. You can view the current weather conditions, as well as a five-day forecast that includes high and low temperatures, humidity, and wind speed.
